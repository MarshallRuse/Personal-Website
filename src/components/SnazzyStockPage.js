            Snazzy Stock is an in-development inventory management app for{" "}
            <NavLink href='https://www.snazzystones.ca' target='_blank'>
                Snazzy Stones Jewellery
            </NavLink>
            , a small retail business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Snazzy Stones currently tracks inventory via hand-written records (for in-person sales) cross-referenced
            with Woocommerce sales records (for website sales) and Etsy CSV exports (
            <NavLink href='https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/SnazzyStonesJewelry' target='_blank'>
                for Etsy sales
            </NavLink>
            ). The idea behind Snazzy Stock is to have one unified platform into which all records of sale or purchase
            order transactions will feed to ensure automatic tracking and to provide sales analytics for products.
        </p>
    </>

        <p>The app takes as input 3 CSV files:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rotations exported from the{" "}
                <NavLink href='https://www.orbs.utoronto.ca/' target='_blank'>
                    Online Rotation & Base Hospital Scheduling (ORBS)
                </NavLink>
            </li>
            <li>A reference table for the Rotation Coordinators of the rotations listed in the rotations file</li>
            <li>A reference table for the EPAs to be completed on the rotations listed in the rotations file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The residents in the first input are grouped by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the rotation</li>
            <li>the hospital the roation is taking place at</li>
            <li>the residents' seniority (i.e. Juniors or Seniors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Four tables are produced:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>all of the residents, Rotation Coordinators, and EPAs matched by rotation and hospital</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with exclusively Junior residents</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with exclusively Senior residents</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with both Junior and Senior residents</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            All of the uploading and data manipulation is done <em>entirely</em> within the browser, and there is no
            outbound network traffic, so the data uploaded is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            For CSV input there is an info panel that explains what headers are required, and specifically missing
            headers are highlighted for the user upon upload. Subsequent uploads are disallowed until the correct
            headers are included. A sample table of data is included with each explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon completion of the uploads (or at any point in between), the output-tables can be exported as a CSV. The
            completed tables can then be used directly as input for pre-constructed Mail Merge documents for emailing to
            the Rotation Coordinators.
